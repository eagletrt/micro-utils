# MICRO-UTILS

This repository contains a variety of useful application and scripts for embedded development,
debug and test.

Each folder inside the main directory contains an independent application with a specific purpose
(refer to the README.md inside each folder for more information), and there is no specific file structure
because each tool has its own, depending on the used programming language and/or build system.
